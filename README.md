## Creating cluster using terraform script - TODO



## Configure codebuild to deploy backend and frontend to EKS
- Will be showing the steps to deploy backend and similar steps can be followed to deploy frontend
- While setting up code build give the Buildspec.yaml file from Github repo path of k8s/backend/buildspec_eks.yaml
- Configure environment varibales by clicking on edit -> Environment and add below environment variables

- Create a ECR for the images and specify the name in env variable with the tag as well
- Specify AWS cluster name in env variable
- Edit service role for code build and add attach inline policies by executing create_iam_role.sh file using
```bash
    sh create_iam_role.sh
  ```

- Even though the CodeBuild role has permission to authenticate to the cluster, it doesnâ€™t have the requisite RBAC access to do any other
action on the cluster. You can even list pods in the cluster. You should read the following quote from EKS documentation:

  <i> "When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, the IAM entity user or role, such as a federated user that creates the cluster, is automatically
granted system:masters permissions in the cluster's RBAC configuration. To grant additional AWS users or roles the ability to interact
with your cluster, you must edit the aws-auth ConfigMap within Kubernetes." </i>

  ```
  eksctl create iamidentitymapping --cluster three-tier-cluster --arn arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/CodeBuildKubectlRole  --group system:masters --username CodeBuildKubectlRole --region=AWS_REGION
  
  ```

- Run the code build
